### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

- &#128187; My name is Daniel Fijalka, I am an aspiring software developer/engineer. I have a previous background in biology and worked in healthcare for several years as a Laboratory Scientist and Lab Info System Specialist. During that time I discovered a love for technology and wanted to learn more about programming and software development. My current role is Software Quality Assurance Analyst. I am fully committed to being a lifelong learner and I believe that goes hand-in-hand with any career in technology. Thank you for checking out my Github page! 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack face-detection app that utilizes a registration and login section, a database of users, and a face-detection API. Check out a demo of a project I recently completed that implements C# and SQL Server at https://youtu.be/Ev1tB7kJNg8!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enrolled in a C++ course! I look forward to completing an Associates in Computer Science this year, after which I'll turn my focus to obtaining a master's degree in Computer Science. I completed a full-stack development bootcamp in 2023 that incorporates HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose. I also supplement my learning with courses on the Coursera platform and Zero to Mastery academy.
